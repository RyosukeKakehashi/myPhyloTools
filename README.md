## ConcatFas.py
A script to concatenate multiple fasta files.

Usage: python ConcatFas.py *input_file*

Input file is a list of fasta files. Please specify path to the files, if files are not in the current directory. Each file should be described in one line. Default output file name is *concatenate.fasta*. You can change the output file name by '-o' option. This script can also construct a partition file with '-p' option.

Note that fasta files with CR+LF newline characters may cause problems.
